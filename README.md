# CS-3560

This is our final project for the class CS 3560, Object Oriented Programming and Design. 
This course was completed during the Summer 2020 semester, so the course itself was only 
5 weeks and we had about 2 weeks to complete the User Interface. Selena created every aspect of
the UI for this project, including creating the icons and designing the overall structure 
and program flow. The database was created by Son, and Selena assisted in inserting the menu 
items into the appropriate tables. The project was created using Java, JavaFX, CSS, and XML. 

This project is a Restaurant order system for the fictional burger restaurant "Out-N-In". All 
logos and icons were created specifically for this project. When successfully linked with the 
database, customers and menu items are available to utilize where necessary in the app. Text 
validation is implemented, so only phone numbers that are registered can be used to login to 
the program. 

I was able to run the program on Netbeans IDE 8.2 with Netbeans Connector J and Xampp with 
phpMyAdmin for the program and database. The new database created should be named "databasenew" 
for proper connection, and lines from "CREATE TABLE `customers`" to the end of the file should 
be copied and pasted to create the database.

Thank you!
